/**
 * overflow-container
 *
 * A max-width container that uses left and right padding in place of margin
 * auto. Since there is no `max-width` style applied, this container will
 * grow to match its child content width. This behaves as a sort of "greedy"
 * min-width.
 *
 * When this is placed in a horizontal scroll container, the content will be
 * aligned with a regular container at the left and right stops.
 *
 * This element's parent must be the width of the page for the style to behave
 * correctly.
